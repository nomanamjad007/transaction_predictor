instacart is an on-demand grocery delivery app that allows a user to browse and pick out products they want from a virtual catalog from local grocery stores. A personal shopper receives your order, and then does the in-store shopping and delivery for you. To improve the grocery shopping experience, it would be advantageous if Instacart could predict what products a customer will purchase again. This will allow Instacart to generate personalized experiences for every user, helping them easily rediscover their favorite products. Creating an efficient and convenient shopping experience for customers will help more users adopt this new format of grocery shopping.
